.SH NAME
.PP
.B bash_builtin
\- Fundamentals for developing Bash loadable builtins in C
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This document is intended to serve as a memory aid for developers who
have experience developing loadable builtins.
It is also an delivery experiment, using
.B groff
to create content that is intended for direct use as a
.B man page
and, through transformation, as an HTML page for access on
.BR GitHub .
.PP
Rather than a step-by-step guide, topics will be in presented in an
order of anticipated most frequent need.
Thus, the first steps, creating a
.B Makefile
and a basic source file template,
will come at the end because they are rarely-needed hints.
.PP
That said, here is an index to the sections to help identify
what kind of help is available, and the section titles to aid in
jumping to remote sections.

.SH RETURN VALUES
.PP
Builtins should use exit value constants for return values.

EXECUTION\(ulFAILURE|Generic failure code
EXECUTION\(ulSUCCESS|Success code is 0, a lack of errors
EX\(ulMISCERROR|Return to indicate unspecified error (EX_BADUSAGE)
EX\(ulNOTFOUND|Return to indicate something not found (ie a file).
EX\(ulBADASSIGN|Return if there was a problem with assigning a value.

Other exit codes may be found in
.BR shell.h .
.SH COLLECTIONS
.PP
There are
.BR ARRAY "s and " LIST s.
The main difference is in how they are constructed and how they are
traversed.
.SS ARRAY
.PP
Refer to
.BR array.h .
.SS LIST
.PP
Refer to
.BR command.h .
.PP
.BR WORD_LIST "s and " PATTERN_LIST s

.SH C TEMPLATE
.PP
There are three basic C objects required to make a loadable builtin, the
entry
.BR function ", " "an  array of strings " "for a long description, and a " "struct builtin "
structure that ties these items together.
